    <p><h3>Smash burgers are formed into balls of ground beef then pressed or smashed with a burger press into a thin patty as soon as they hit the grill.</h3></p>

    <p><h2>Smash Burger Ingredients</h2></p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 soft hamburger roll, buttered and toasted
            <li>Condiments and toppings as desired, such as mayonnaise, mustard, shredded lettuce, onions, tomatoes, and pickles</li>
            </li>4 ounces (110g) freshly ground beef chuck, divided into two 2-ounce (55g) balls</li>
            <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 slice good melting cheese, such as American, cheddar, or homemade melting cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <p><h2>The Steps</h2></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare burger bun by laying toppings on bottom half of bun. Have it nearby and ready for when your burger is cooked.</li>

        <li> Preheat a large stainless steel saut√© pan or skillet over high heat for 2 minutes. Place balls of beef in pan and smash down with a stiff metal spatula, using a second spatula to add pressure. Smashed patties should be slightly wider than burger bun.</li>
            
            
        <li>Season generously with salt and pepper and allow to cook until patties are well browned and tops are beginning to turn pale pink/gray in spots, about 45 seconds. Using a bench scraper or the back side of a stiff metal spatula, carefully scrape patties from pan, making sure to get all of the browned bits.</li>
            
            
        <li>Flip patties and immediately place a slice of cheese over 1 patty, then stack the second directly on top. Immediately remove from pan and transfer to waiting burger bun. Serve.</li>
    </ol>
